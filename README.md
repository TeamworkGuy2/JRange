JRanges
==========

Java classes for storing, searching, and manipulating char, int, and float ranges. 

A range has an upper and lower bound. 

A Char/Int/FloatRangeSet represents a set of upper and lower bounds which can be searched. 

The 'Ranges' utility has methods for handling overlapping ranges and adding new ranges to existing sets of ranges. 

See 'test' package for examples.
